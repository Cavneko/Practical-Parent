Iteration 1
-----------

We created a custom app icon and a custom main screen background image (derived from images found
online, references can be found in the About screen).

As most children like music, we added background music to the app (which can be toggled on/off).
This will help the parent calm their children down if they are unhappy.

We added a nice background image and a smooth countdown animation to the timeout screen to make
the timeout screen more calming and peaceful. The colors chosen are subdued and not bold or
stress inducing.

We were careful about our image sizes and compressed all of them using TinyPNG (tinypng.com)
to reduce the size of our app.
