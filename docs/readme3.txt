Iteration 3
-----------

We continued working on the resizing of numerous activities so that the app is visually appealing for every screen size.

We have added a new activity called "Take a Breath", allowing the child to calm down and relax upon interacting with an animated button:
1. The button is animated so that it mimics the expansion and contraction of the lungs, in addition to the breathing sound effects.
2. We have used the word 'breaths' for plural numbers and 'breath' if the number is one, so that they are grammatically correct.

We believe that sometimes the behaviour of the "Take a Breath" activity may be confusing to a user and we likely would have implemented it 
differently if given the option. However, the implemented behaviour follows the requirements specified in the user stories & in the state machine.
